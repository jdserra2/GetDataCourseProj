The GetDataCourseProj repository contains the relevant files related 

to the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.


The objective of the Course Project is to Generate a tidy data set that

contains the average variable data of the mean and standard deviation

measurement readings from the Training and Test data sets.


The resulting data set is a consolidation of the data from both

data sets.


============================================

The repository contains the following files:

- 'README.md'

- 'run_analysis.R': The R script that was used to generate the required course project tidy data set. 

- 'CodeBook.txt' :  The data dictionary documentation that shows the relevant information for each field/variable that is contained in the 
		    output file generated by the run_analysis.R program.
